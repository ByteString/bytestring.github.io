Throughout my Second Life, I've built and scripted and written and administered and moderated roleplaying  games. I've also spent a lot of time as a player. I've learned one key lesson.

I am cripplingly opinionated when it comes to the development of RP sims and because of this I am a terrible fit for playing in other people's game worlds.

It's the coherency and the consistency of their lore. It's the responsiveness and professionalism of their volunteer staff. I understand that parts of my position (at least) are ridiculous but these are my feels with regard to an artform so I get to have them even if they're silly.

I love to discover new game worlds. I immedidately consume all available lore fast enough that I can ignore the  few immediately observable plot holes because I am JUST SO FULL of lore. Then I dive into the game proper with a new character, then another, then another. I have a little list with over 100 alts on it, so I select the most appropriate five and explore the world with a few different sets of eyes.

I may find here that I am missing context for parts of my character and request that game lore be fleshed out where I find it lacking. This information is provided and I am temporarily sated.

I may find that the sim owners have selected administrative staff based on who was involved in leaving a previous sim or simply from a very limited pool of candidates, rather than on the merits of their administrative ability. This is understandable, given that moderating a roleplaying game is typically an unpaid and so often unskilled position. It is understandable and regrettable because these people are key to the survival of the game and provide a first impression to players of what sim administration is like to interact with. Typically, if a GM is failing to perform in the early days of a sim, this failure is left unchecked and the sim suffers for it, especially if that GM is being relied on to facilitate a key piece of gameplay, like recruiting for a major faction or answering road-block questions that players need answered before they continue. Let's say I make do without these GMs, though.

AUTHOR'S NOTE. I wrote this much of this post and then went to bed, then I returned to finish it off but in the meantime some silly GM got all condescending to players who wanted a plot point explained a bit more plausibly, so I'm changing the angle from respectful criticism to HOLY MOTHER OF DICKS Y'ALL ARE TRIPPING WHAT EVEN IS WRONG WITH YOU CAPS LOCK ENGAAAAAAGED.

WE INTERRUPT THIS BLOG POST FOR A SPECIAL NEWS BULLETIN. SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF IS NOT A MAGIC PILL YOU SWALLOW TO IGNORE THE DISCOMFORT OF YOUR CREDIBILITY AS AN AUTHOR LEAKING OUT OF THE HOLES IN YOUR PLOT. IT IS YOUR AUDIENCE'S POETIC FAITH AND THEY ARE TRUSTING YOU WITH IT. YOUR MAIN FUCKING JOB AS A PRODUCER OF STORIES IS TO RESPECT AND CAREFULLY MAINTAIN THIS FAITH BECAUSE IT IS A CRITICAL ELEMENT OF YOUR AUDIENCE'S ENJOYMENT OF YOUR GAME WORLD.

That is to say... it is not a player's responsibility to put their disbelief aside while you shovel shit into their faces and tell them it's art. It's your job to make sure that the single goddamn product you are responsible for delivering does not, upon receipt, spoil the user's ability to enjoy it.

It is ridiculous to assert that players who aren't enjoying themselves just need to be less picky about the quality of the stories you feed them.. and it's appallingly disrespectful to dismiss their requirements for coherent, internally consistent narratives. Please understand that your target audience will invest themselves very heavily in the story you construct and spend hours upon hours amongst themselves discussing and dissecting and analysing every little scrap of information you provide them about the world their characters live in... to turn around and offer TROLOLOL IT'S ALL IMAGINARY ANYWAY in response to criticism is a slap in the face for some pretty committed fans of your work.

Sweet merciful fuck, I swear. Every goddamn time I start to buy into someone's story they wait until I'm settled in and ready to listen and then INSTADERPFACE and they just start with the inane prattling.

I GUESS THIS IS WHY I NEED TO BUILD A PLACE. HOLY SHIT. IS THAT WHERE I WAS GOING TO GO WHEN I STARTED? NOPE, BUT... DEAR LORD. *DROPS THE MIC*
